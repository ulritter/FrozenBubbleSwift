#  Frozen Bubble for iOS Re-Implementation

I have always liked to play "Frozen Bubble" both on Linux Systems way back in the 90s and later on Android due to its simplicity and its lovely penguin artwork.

When I switched back to using an iPhone again, I missed this game. There were similar games in the AppStore but nothing that would compare to what I had in mind. 

So I decided to completely re-write this game from scratch using parts of the original artwork and sound effects. And, as opposed to fiddling around with old Java code I wanted to create a  modern implementation using Swift and the SpriteKit physics engine so that I wouldn't have to bother too much with object dynamics. 

The current implementation is fairly straightforward without too many bells and whistles. It is a pure single player game where the user can switch between two different bubble styles (plain or with marks for color blind people), and sound effects can be toggled. Background music is not yet implemented, but might well be in the future.

Enjoy!
